# Day 06 â€“ Arrays Medium (Java)

## âœ… What I Learned
- Arrays can be manipulated using **two pointers** or **extra space**.
- Common problems:
  1. Rotate array (left/right)
  2. Move zeroes to the end
  3. Union of two arrays
  4. Intersection of two arrays

---

## ðŸ“– Problems Practiced
1. Left Rotate an array by D places
2. Right Rotate an array by D places
3. Move all zeroes to end while keeping order
4. Find Union of two arrays
5. Find Intersection of two arrays

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
- Rotation can be done using:
  - Extra space (O(n))
  - Reversal method (in-place, O(1) extra space)
- Union/Intersection problems need **HashSet** or sorting.
- Moving zeroes uses **two-pointer approach** efficiently.
