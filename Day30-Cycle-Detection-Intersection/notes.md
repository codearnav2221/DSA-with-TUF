# Day 30 ‚Äì Detect & Remove Cycle, Find Intersection Point

## ‚úÖ What I Learned

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Detect Cycle (Floyd‚Äôs Cycle Detection)
- Use two pointers: **slow** and **fast**.
- Move `slow` by 1 step and `fast` by 2 steps.
- If they meet ‚Üí cycle exists.
- If `fast` or `fast.next` becomes null ‚Üí no cycle.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Find Start of Cycle
- After detection, set one pointer to head.
- Move both 1 step at a time ‚Üí they meet at cycle start.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Remove Cycle
- Once start node is known:
  - Traverse from that node until `.next` = start node, then make `.next = null`.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Intersection of Two LLs
- Two LLs may intersect at a node.
- Find lengths of both LLs.
- Move the longer list's head forward by `diff`.
- Traverse both until they meet ‚Üí intersection point.
