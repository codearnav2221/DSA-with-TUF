# Day 20 â€“ Sort a Linked List + Reorder List

## âœ… What I Learned
### 1. Sort a Linked List
- Sorting a linked list efficiently = **Merge Sort**.
- Reason: QuickSort/HeapSort not efficient due to random access issues.
- Steps:
  1. Find middle using slow/fast pointer.
  2. Recursively sort both halves.
  3. Merge two sorted halves.

### 2. Reorder List
- Rearrange list as: L0 â†’ Ln â†’ L1 â†’ Ln-1 â†’ ...
- Steps:
  1. Find middle.
  2. Reverse second half.
  3. Merge two halves alternately.

## ðŸ“– Problems Practiced
1. Sort Linked List (Merge Sort)
2. Reorder Linked List

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
- Merge Sort is **O(N log N)** for linked list.
- Reordering uses **middle + reverse + merge** trick.
- Both are **very popular interview problems**.
