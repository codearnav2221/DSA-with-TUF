# Day 04 â€“ Recursion Advanced (Java)

## âœ… What I Learned
- Recursion can be used for **subsets, subsequences, permutations**, and solving complex problems.
- Idea: Break down the problem into **choice-based recursion**:
  - Either include the current element
  - Or exclude it

---

## ðŸ“– Problems Practiced
1. Print all subsequences of an array
2. Print all subsets of a string
3. Calculate power of a number (x^n) using recursion
4. Generate all permutations of a string

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
- Subset/subsequence problems require **decision-making recursion**.
- String and array recursion problems strengthen **backtracking concepts**.
- Helps in later problems like N-Queens, Rat in a Maze, etc.
