# Day 19 â€“ Add Two Numbers (LL) + Flatten Binary Tree to LL

## âœ… What I Learned
### 1. Add Two Numbers (Linked List)
- Each linked list represents a non-negative integer in reverse order.
- Traverse both lists simultaneously.
- Maintain carry while adding nodes.
- Build result list iteratively.

### 2. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List
- Given a binary tree, flatten it into a right-skewed linked list (like preorder traversal).
- Approaches:
  - Recursive: DFS, modify pointers.
  - Iterative (Morris Traversal style): For each node, attach left subtree between node & right subtree.

## ðŸ“– Problems Practiced
1. Add Two Numbers (LL)
2. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
- Linked list addition = grade-school addition with carry.
- Flatten BT modifies tree in place, no extra nodes created.
- Both problems appear in **Google, Amazon, Microsoft interviews**.
