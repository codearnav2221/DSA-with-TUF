# Day 02 â€“ Patterns & Introduction to Recursion (Java)

## âœ… What I Learned
### Patterns
- Printing patterns helps to improve understanding of **nested loops**.
- Important to learn controlling **rows, columns, spaces, and stars**.

### Recursion
- A function calling itself until a **base condition** is met.
- Useful in problems like factorial, Fibonacci, and backtracking.

## ðŸ“– Key Takeaways
- **Patterns** strengthen logic building and nested loop concepts.
- **Recursion** needs:
  1. Base case (stop condition)
  2. Recursive case (smaller subproblem)
- Without a base case â†’ infinite recursion â†’ stack overflow.
