# Day 07 â€“ Arrays Hard (Java)

## âœ… What I Learned
- Subarray problems are key in arrays â†’ sliding window & hashing are common tools.
- Prefix sum and HashMap help in solving sum-related problems.

---

## ðŸ“– Problems Practiced
1. Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm â†’ Maximum Subarray Sum
2. Maximum Subarray (print subarray as well)
3. 2-Sum Problem
4. 3-Sum Problem
5. Maximum Product Subarray

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
- Kadaneâ€™s algorithm works in O(n) for maximum sum.
- Use HashMap to solve **2-sum in O(n)** instead of O(nÂ²).
- Nested loops are acceptable for 3-sum, but better optimized with sorting + 2 pointers.
- Prefix product & min/max tracking helps in max product subarray.
