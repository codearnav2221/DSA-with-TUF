# Day 03 â€“ Recursion Basics (Java)

## âœ… What I Learned
- Recursion is solving a problem by breaking it into smaller subproblems.
- Always define:
  1. **Base case** (stopping condition)
  2. **Recursive case** (smaller input)

## ðŸ“– Problems Practiced
1. Print numbers from 1 to N
2. Print numbers from N to 1
3. Sum of first N numbers
4. Reverse an array using recursion

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
- Without a base case â†’ stack overflow
- Each recursive call stores state in the **function call stack**
- Recursion is powerful but can be less efficient than iteration if not optimized
