# Day 12 â€“ Singly Linked List Basics

## âœ… What I Learned
- A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are connected using pointers.
- Each **Node** has:
  - `data`
  - `next` pointer (address of next node)
- Unlike arrays:
  - Size is dynamic
  - Random access not possible (must traverse sequentially)

---

## ðŸ“– Operations Practiced
1. Create a Linked List
2. Insert at Head
3. Insert at Tail
4. Insert at Position
5. Delete Node
6. Traverse/Print Linked List

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
- LL gives efficient **insertions/deletions** compared to arrays.
- Traversals are **O(n)**.
- Need to handle **null pointers** carefully.
