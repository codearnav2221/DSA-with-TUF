# Day 14 â€“ Middle of LL & Cycle Detection

## âœ… What I Learned
- **Middle of LL**: Use slow & fast pointers.
- **Cycle Detection**: Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise & Hare).
- **Cycle Length**: Once cycle is detected, measure loop length by moving a pointer until it meets again.
- **Cycle Start Node**: Reset one pointer to head, move both one step â†’ meeting point is start of cycle.

## ðŸ“– Problems Practiced
1. Find Middle Node of Linked List
2. Detect if a Linked List has a Cycle
3. Find Length of Cycle
4. Find Start Node of Cycle

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
- Slow & Fast pointers (tortoise & hare) are powerful for LL problems.
- Detect cycle â†’ find cycle length â†’ find cycle start node.
- Many advanced LL problems build on these concepts.
