# Day 11 â€“ Binary Search on Answers (Advanced Problems)

## âœ… What I Learned
- Binary Search is not only for arrays but also for **answer space**.
- Used when:
  - Problem asks for min/max feasible value.
  - Constraints are monotonic (if X works, all >X or <X also work).

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways

- Write **isPossible() check** to validate feasibility.
- Apply **binary search** on answer.
