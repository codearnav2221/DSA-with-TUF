x# Day 08 â€“ Binary Search Basics (Java)

## âœ… What I Learned
- Binary Search works on **sorted arrays**.
- Divide and Conquer approach â†’ reduces search from O(n) â†’ O(log n).
- Always check for **mid** and decide whether to move **left** or **right**.

---

## ðŸ“– Problems Practiced
1. Basic Binary Search (Iterative + Recursive)
2. First and Last Occurrence of an element
3. Floor and Ceil in Sorted Array
4. Count Occurrences of an element

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
- Works only on **sorted input**.
- Time Complexity â†’ O(log n)
- Space Complexity â†’ O(1) (iterative), O(log n) (recursive due to stack)
- Edge cases: duplicates, element not present.
