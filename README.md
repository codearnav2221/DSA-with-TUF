# DSA-with-TUF
# ðŸš€ DSA-with_TUF (90 Days Challenge in Java)

This repository contains my **90 days DSA journey** following [Take U Forward](https://takeuforward.org/) roadmap.  
I will solve problems daily in **Java** and maintain notes for quick revision.

- [Day 02](./Day02-Patterns-Recursion) â†’ Pattern Printing (loops & stars) + Introduction to Recursion
- [Day 03](./Day03-Recursion-Basics) â†’ Basic Recursion problems (print numbers, sum, reverse array)
- [Day 04](./Day04-Recursion-Advanced) â†’ Advanced Recursion (subsequences, subsets, power, permutations)
- [Day 05](./Day05-Arrays-Basics) â†’ Arrays basics (max, min, reverse, linear search, sorted check)
- [Day 06](./Day06-Arrays-Medium) â†’ Arrays Medium (rotate, move zeroes, union, intersection)
- [Day 07](./Day07-Arrays-Hard) â†’ Arrays Hard (Kadaneâ€™s, 2-sum, 3-sum, max product subarray)
- [Day 08](./Day08-BinarySearch-Basics) â†’ Binary Search Basics (iterative, recursive, first/last occurrence, floor/ceil)
- [Day 09](./05-Sorting-Searching/Day09-BinarySearch-Advanced) â†’ Binary Search Advanced (rotated array, single element, peak element, sqrt)
