# DSA-with-TUF
# ðŸš€ DSA-with_TUF (90 Days Challenge in Java)

This repository contains my **90 days DSA journey** following [Take U Forward](https://takeuforward.org/) roadmap.  
I will solve problems daily in **Java** and maintain notes for quick revision.

## ðŸ“Œ Progress Log

- [Day 01](./Day01-TimeComplexity) â†’ Time Complexity (O(1), O(n), O(n^2))
- [Day 02](./Day02-Patterns-Recursion) â†’ Pattern Printing (loops & stars) + Introduction to Recursion
- [Day 03](./Day03-Recursion-Basics) â†’ Basic Recursion problems (print numbers, sum, reverse array)
- [Day 04](./Day04-Recursion-Advanced) â†’ Advanced Recursion (subsequences, subsets, power, permutations)
- [Day 05](./Day05-Arrays-Basics) â†’ Arrays basics (max, min, reverse, linear search, sorted check)
- [Day 06](./Day06-Arrays-Medium) â†’ Arrays Medium (rotate, move zeroes, union, intersection)

- Day 06 â†’ Coming soon...
