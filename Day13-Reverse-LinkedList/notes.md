# Day 13 â€“ Reverse Linked List (Iterative + Recursive)

## âœ… What I Learned
- Reversing a linked list changes the `next` pointers of all nodes.
- Two common approaches:
  1. **Iterative Method** (using 3 pointers: prev, curr, next)
  2. **Recursive Method** (reverses rest of list and fixes pointers)

## ðŸ“– Problems Practiced
1. Reverse a Linked List (Iterative)
2. Reverse a Linked List (Recursive)

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
- Iterative is simple & O(n) time, O(1) space.
- Recursive is elegant but uses O(n) stack space.
- Reversal is a base concept for many LL problems (palindrome, rotation, etc.).
