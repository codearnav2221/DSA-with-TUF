- Binary Search is not just for simple searching, it can be applied to **answers / conditions**.
- Often used in:
  - Rotated sorted arrays
  - Searching in unsorted patterns
  - Peak element problems
  - Binary Search on answers (like min/max feasible values)

## ðŸ“– Problems Practiced
1. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
2. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
3. Search Single Element in a Sorted Array (all others appear twice)
4. Find Peak Element
5. Square Root using Binary Search
