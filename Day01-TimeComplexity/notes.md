# Day 01 – Time & Space Complexity (Java)

##  Learned From
Video: *Time and Space Complexity – Strivers A2Z DSA Course*

##  Key Concepts

- **Time Complexity** describes how the running time of an algorithm grows with input size.
- **Space Complexity** measures how much extra memory an algorithm uses.

###  Common Notations
- **O(1):** Constant time/space — independent of input size  
- **O(log n):** Logarithmic — e.g., binary search  
- **O(n):** Linear — e.g., single loop  
- **O(n log n):** Linearithmic — e.g., efficient sorting  
- **O(n²):** Quadratic — e.g., nested loops

###  Summary
Understanding these complexities helps you write efficient code and choose the right algorithm for performance-critical tasks.```
